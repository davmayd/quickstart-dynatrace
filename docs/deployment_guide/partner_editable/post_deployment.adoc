. From the Home screen, you can navigate to the configuration of each node. You can change the IP address for each node to one of Elastic IP addresses of the Network Load Balancer. After doing this you will be able to use the pre-generated domain name to access the cluster UI.
. Proceed with other configuration adjustments if needed.

== Best Practices Using the Dynatrace Managed Cluster on AWS

=== High Availability and Performance

We recommend that you use three Availability Zones if possible and run at least three nodes to ensure high availability of the cluster. If you decide to start very small and use only one node, we still recommend that you configure the VPC with three Availability Zones and three public and private subnets. You can add nodes to the cluster, but you won’t be able to easily reconfigure the VPC after it has been created.

While you don’t need to come up with the exact cluster sizing initially, we recommend getting acquainted with the https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/deploy-dynatrace/managed/installation/hardware-and-operating-system-requirements/[Dynatrace Managed hardware requirements].
