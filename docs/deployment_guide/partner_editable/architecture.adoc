.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image1.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet. This gateway is used by the bastion hosts to send and receive traffic.*
* In the public subnets, managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the public subnets, a Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in private subnets.*
* A Network Load Balancer that can be used to access the Dynatrace Managed cluster and send monitoring data from outside of the VPC.
* Three Elastic IP addresses used by the Network Load Balancer.
* In each of the private subnets, an Amazon EC2 instance with Dynatrace Managed server installed. Each Amazon EC2 instance is using six Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. For each instance there is also an Amazon CloudWatch alarm defined for Amazon EC2 Auto Recovery.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

*Note* We recommend using three Availability Zones for the deployment. If your Region does not support three Availability Zones, you can deploy Dynatrace Managed across two Availability Zones.
